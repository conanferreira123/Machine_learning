import numpy as np
list1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]#list can store values of diff data types which can be difficult to manipulate in large datasets
#thus we use numpy arrays instead of lists in machine learning.
list1=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])#numpy array
print(list1.shape)#prints the number of elements in the list
